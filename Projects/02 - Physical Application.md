## PROJECT 2: PHYSICAL APPLICATION 
Your final logo in color in a physical, applied state (i.e. packaging, signage, apparel, business cards, stickers, poster announcing an event etc.). Your choice for your logo’s applied state is up to you. You decide. There are literally hundreds of possible applied states. 

#### Physical Application 1st Draft    
Post in the #project-physapp channel on Slack

* Select 3 potential applied state for your one **final** logo
* For those selected applied states, do at least 3 different directions/designed applications of your logo
* In other words, if you are going to do a cd cover, do 3 different versions for a cd cover. If you are also thinking of doing a business card, also do 3 different versions of a business card. 
* Each version should be on an artboard in letter dimensions (8 1/2 x 11)

#### Physical Application 2nd Draft    
Post a PDF (exported from Illustrator/Photoshop) in the #project-physapp channel on Slack

* Choose the version selected in the previous class crit.
* Select only 1 applied state (yes, this is repeated.)
* Do at least 3 different variations of the selected physical application of your logo. 
* Each variation on a page with letter dimensions (8 1/2 x 11)

#### Physical Application Final    
Get your final physical application produced/fabricated at a service bureau of your choice, using the NYU Tandon maker space, or using your own ingenuity and craft.

**DO NOT BE LATE WITH YOUR FINAL PHYSICAL APPLICATION!**
