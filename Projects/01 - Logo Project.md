## PROJECT: LOGO
Create a logo for your selected brand in Adobe Illustrator.

####Decide on your Brand, Organization, Company, etc.
* Select a 4-6 character combination of letters and/or numbers.
* Write a few sentences describing the brand/organization/company, things like its name (is it an abbreviation for something, like NYU?), what it does, who its audience is, etc. Feel free to bring in more than one brand if you're not sure.
* Throughout the semester, we’ll be investigating ways to visually communicate this brand, through creating an identity system which will consist of a logo and a physical application of the logo. Consider what kind of physical object you may want to fabricate and how it communicates the identity of the brand/organization/company
  * Is it a tool that's useful to do a particular task?
  * Is it a piece of clothing/accessory that's given away as swag?
  * You don't have to decide until after midterm, but it's helpful to keep this next project in mind while you're designing.

####LOGO 1st Draft  
* **At least 10 different logo ideas**, iterating on the visual character of your selected brand **ALL in grayscale (this includes black & white)**
* One logo per 8 1/2 x 11 (letter) dimensions for a total of at least 10 images
  * at least 3 should be done digitally
  * at least 3 should be haptic (non-digital, drawn by hand in pen on paper) 
  * the remaining 4 concepts can be done either by hand or digitally
  * You will need to digitize haptic files (i.e. scan or take a digital photo, etc.)
* Also consider creating haptic / digital combos
* To comprise your different versions, play around with creating [icons/symbols, logotypes, and/or combination logos](http://www.logodesignsource.com/types.html)
* Post a multi-page PDF to the Slack channel #project-logo, and print out/bring in all pieces of paper and we will pin them up on the white boards for our first design critique


#### LOGO 2nd Draft  
* Make a multi-artboard Illustrator file
* Add the name of your personal brand, along with a very brief description (1 to 2 sentences max) of what your logo is to the top of each page
* Choose 3 of your 10 previous design directions, and do **at least 5 different variations of each logo** iterations in grayscale (black & white) or color, for a total of ***at least* 15 iterations**.
* One logo per letter dimensions ( 8 1/2 x 11) for a total of at least 15 pages
* For this draft, you must design a small version (a little bigger than postage stamp size, or 2"x2") of each of your 15 iterations, placed in the lower left hand corner of the page board.
* Post a multi-page PDF (export from Illustrator) to the Slack channel #project-logo

#### LOGO Final  
* Post a PDF (export from Illustrator) to the Slack channel #project-logo
* In order to arrive at your final logo, you will have to do many more iterations of your selected logo version. I would like to see the iterations you made to get to your final logo, as well.
* **Final logo** should be in color and on a page with letter dimensions (8 1/2 x 11) with a big version & a tiny version (a little bigger than postage size) in the lower left corner
* Bring in as much of your process between your 2nd and final drafts as you feel is important to explain how you arrived at your final design.
  * **Remember: Process is just as important as final product!**
