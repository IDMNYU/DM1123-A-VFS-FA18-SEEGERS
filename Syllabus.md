## Welcome to Visual Foundation Studio!

This course allows students to harness the power of visual language in order to convey messages and meaning. The elements of visual foundation that will be covered include components (color, texture, image and typography), composition, and concept. Although non-digital mediums will be addressed, the understanding and use of industry-standard software is also a primary goal.


### PROGRAM GOALS

The following Integrated Digital Media program goals are reinforced within this course. Students will:

* 1 – Develop **conceptual, creative thinking skills** to generate ideas and content in order to solve problems or create opportunities.
  * Students will develop a research and studio practice through inquiry and iteration.
* 2 – Develop **technical skills** to realize their ideas.
  * Students will understand and utilize tools and technology, while adapting to constantly changing technological paradigms by learning how to learn.
  * Be able to integrate/interface different technologies within a technological ecosystem.
* 3 – Students will develop **critical thinking skills** that will allow them to analyze and position their work within cultural, historic, aesthetic, economic, and technological contexts.


### COURSE GOALS

This course will reinforce or introduce students to:

* Introduction to the 3 C's of visual language: components, composition & concept
* Increased visual awareness and vocabulary through research and observation
* Increased competency in visually communicating ideas and meaning through practice and iteration
* An introduction to Adobe Illustrator, Adobe InDesign, and Adobe Photoshop


### LEARNING OUTCOMES

By the end of the course, students will be able to:

* understand and implement an iterative design process
* learn how to proactively learn, also known as self-regulated learning
* In any learning situation, you should study beforehand, make/do, debug, reflect, adjust, and do it all over again (iteration). Learning happens in a cycle.


### COURSE STRUCTURE

Class will be comprised of lectures, class exercises, screenings, show & tells, demos, and studio critiques. We will also have a guest speaker (Date to be determined, depending on their schedule). 

Critiques (AKA crits) are the best way to articulate your ideas to others and get immediate feedback. During the crit, the professor and your classmates analyze and suggest ways to increase the visual and conceptual impact of each existing idea. Take notes when your work is being critiqued and do not edit the responses, whether you agree with them or not. Review your crit notes and reflect upon what was said. Ask yourself how you could combine, transform, or expand the ideas that show the most promise. However, resist the temptation to incorporate all suggestions and comments. Only utilize the ones that work for you and your project. 

Rules of the Critique:

* Be Present and Engaged
* Give Feedback to your classmates
* Do NOT take feedback personally.

Students will conduct self assessments as well as be evaluated by the professor during or after midterm and at the end of the semester. Any action without reflection is meaningless. Real learning only occurs as part of a reflective process. Reflection is studying your own practice as seriously as you study anything. It involves thinking about why, what, and how you create something. 


### STUDENT RESPONSIBILITIES

* Schedule your time (keep a calendar of some sort) 
* Come to class on time and participate (be present and engaged)
* Study outside of class (ideally with classmates)
* Devote at a minimum 4 to 8 hours per week outside of class, fulfilling homework assignments, reading, and studying concepts covered in class.
* Complete all assignments by due dates
* Acquire and read all assigned readings before they are due
* Action – do your absolute best
* Strive for continuous improvement
* Email contact about logistics (when, where, how many?) only
* Talk to me in person about issues and problems. Do not email long conversations. (if your email turns into a paragraph or two that means you should be talking to me in person, not emailing me.)
* Have desire amounting to enthusiasm (to learn, to explore)
* Have patience, persistence, and discipline 
* Be creative
* Pay attention to detail & craft
* Have self-confidence and pride in your work
* Take risks & be fearless in your projects
* Have fun!


### EVALUATION & GRADING

##### Attendance

* Attendance is mandatory and will be taken at the beginning of every class. Since there is so much technical, conceptual, and design information to absorb, regular attendance is essential.
* Unexcused absences will affect your grade. One absence is allowed; after that, your final, overall, numerical grade will drop by 5 percent (1/2 a grade point (e.g. A to an A-)) for each additional absence.
* Be on Time. Tardiness will affect your grade. For every 15 minutes of tardiness, your final, numerical grade will drop by 0.25 points
* Contact the professor IN ADVANCE if you will not be in class (in person or by email is preferred).
* Attendance is __mandatory__ for the midterm and final presentations.

#### Your final grade will be based on a synthesis of quantitative & qualitative rubrics:

##### Qualitative Grading Overview

Each student will be judged on the quality, experimentation, and improvement that their work shows.

###### A. Excellent (90-100)
Performance, participation, and attendance of the student has been of the highest level, showing sustained excellence in meeting course responsibilities. Work clearly differentiates itself from other work, has memorable impact, pursues concepts and techniques above and beyond what is discussed in class. The student thoroughly understands the theory and practice behind visual foundation.

###### B. Very Good / Good (80-89)
Performance, participation, and attendance of the student has been good, though not of the highest level. Work demonstrates a better than average understanding of visual foundation theory & practice.

###### C. Satisfactory (70-79)
Performance and attendance of the student has been adequate, satisfactorily meeting the course requirements. Work is average and competent, showing a basic understanding of visual foundation theory & practice.

###### D. Poor; Below Average (60-69)
Performance and attendance of the student has been less than adequate. Work is lacking in many or most areas that show any understanding of visual foundation. Problems may include lack of interest, procrastination, poor planning and poor craft.

###### F. Unacceptable (59 & Below)
Performance and attendance of the student has been such that course requirements have not been met. Work shows no overall understanding of the course material on many levels or either a severe lack of interest. 

### TECHNOLOGY USE IN THE CLASSROOM

This class is about visual foundation principles first and foremost & technology second. Through lectures & demos, we will cover many important technical issues, but—as in the professional world—the burden of technology will always lie squarely on the designer’s shoulders. Community tech sharing is highly advised as well. In this syllabus and on github, I have listed several helpful resources to help you get up to speed with technology. 

Laptop computers and other mobile devices are invaluable tools for artists, designers, and students when used responsibly. However, this technology can also be incredibly distracting, especially in the classroom. When in class, you may use your laptops and other devices for any activities pertaining to the course: taking notes, researching material relevant to our readings and discussions, doing VFS homework, making class presentations, etc. However, the following uses are unacceptable: checking email, instant messaging, texting, using social networking sites such as facebook, etc. Also, during class screenings, your laptops should not be used.


### READINGS
There are two types of reading in this course: technical and theoretical. The former will offer practical exercises and explanations designed to teach production skills you will need for assignments. The latter provide conceptual, historical, and cultural background that will allow you to understand visual foundation principles. Because this course is an exploration of theory AND practice, I expect full attention to both types of reading.


### ACADEMIC HONESTY

All work for this class must be your own and specific to this semester. Any work recycled from other classes or from another, non-original source will be rejected with serious implications for the student. Plagiarism, knowingly representing the words or ideas of another as one’s own work in any academic exercise, is absolutely unacceptable. Any student who commits plagiarism must re-do the assignment for a grade no higher than a D. In fact, a D is the highest possible course grade for any student who commits plagiarism. Please use the MLA style for citing and documenting source material.   


### ACADEMIC ACCOMMODATIONS

If you are student with a disability who is requesting accommodations, please contact New York University’s Moses Center for Students with Disabilities at 212-998-4980 or mosescsd@nyu.edu.
